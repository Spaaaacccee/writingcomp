const txt = "The wolf and the lamb. Wolf, meeting with a lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the lamb the wolf's right to eat him. He thus addressed him: &quot;sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me.&quot; &quot;indeed,&quot; bleated the lamb in a mournful tone of voice, &quot;i was not then born.&quot; then said the wolf, &quot;you feed in my pasture.&quot; &quot;no, good sir,&quot; replied the lamb, &quot;i have not yet tasted grass.&quot; again said the wolf, &quot;you drink of my well.&quot; &quot;no,&quot; exclaimed the lamb, &quot;i never yet drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me.&quot; upon which the wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, &quot;well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations.&quot; the tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny. The bat and the weasels a bat who fell upon the ground and was caught by a weasel pleaded to be spared his life. The weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds. The bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him. The weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. The bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time escaped. It is wise to turn circumstances to good account. The ass and the grasshopper an ass having heard some grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices. They replied, &quot;the dew.&quot; the ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a short time died of hunger. The lion and the mouse a kion was awakened from sleep by a mouse running over his face. Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the mouse piteously entreated, saying: &quot;if you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness.&quot; the lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by st ropes to the ground. The mouse, recognizing his roar, came gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaim &quot;you ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; I now you know that it is possible for even a mouse to con benefits on a lion.&quot; the charcoal-burner and the fuller a charcoal-burner carried on his trade in his own house. One day he met a friend, a fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened. The fuller replied, &quot;the arrangement is impossible as far as I am concerned, for whatever I should whiten, you would immediately blacken again with your charcoal.&quot; like will draw like. The father and his sons a father had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his sons' hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then addressed them in these words: &quot;my sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.&quot; the boy hunting locusts a boy was hunting for locusts. He had caught a goodly number, when he saw a scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his hand to take him. The scorpion, showing his sting, said: if you had but touched me, my friend, you would have lost me, and all your locusts too!&quot; the cock and the jewel a cock, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious stone and exclaimed: &quot;if your owner had found thee, and not i, he would have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have found thee for no purpose. I would rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world.&quot; the kingdom of the lion the beasts of the field and forest had a lion as their king. He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the wolf and the lamb, the panther and the kid, the tiger and the stag, the dog and the hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity. The hare said, &quot;oh, how I have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the side of the strong.&quot; and after the hare said this, he ran for his life. The wolf and the crane a wolf who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a crane, for a large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: &quot;why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.&quot; in serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains. The fisherman piping a fisherman skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord dance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said: &quot;o you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so merrily.&quot; hercules and the wagoner a carter was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to hercules to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed him: &quot;put your shoulders to the wheels, my man. Goad on your bullocks, and never more pray to me for help, until you have done your best to help yourself, or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain.&quot; self-help is the best help. The ants and the grasshopper the ants were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected in the summertime. A grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a little food. The ants inquired of him, &quot;why did you not treasure up food during the summer?' he replied, &quot;i had not leisure enough. I passed the days in singing.&quot; they then said in derision: &quot;if you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter.&quot; the traveler and his dog a traveler about to set out on a journey saw his dog stand at the door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: &quot;why do you stand there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly.&quot; the dog, wagging his tail, replied: &quot;o, master! I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting.&quot; the loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend. The dog and the shadow a dog, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away. The mole and his mother a mole, a creature blind from birth, once said to his mother: &quot;i am sure than I can see, mother!&quot; in the desire to prove to him his mistake, his mother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and asked, &quot;what is it?' the young mole said, &quot;it is a pebble.&quot; his mother exclaimed: &quot;my son, I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell. The herdsman and the lost bull a herdsman tending his flock in a forest lost a bull-calf from the fold. After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only discover the thief who had stolen the calf, he would offer a lamb in sacrifice to hermes, pan, and the guardian deities of the forest. Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a lion feeding on the calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his hands to heaven, and said: &quot;just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the guardian deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed me; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a full-grown bull to the calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own escape from him in safety.&quot; the hare and the tortoise a hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the tortoise, who replied, laughing: &quot;though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race.&quot; the hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the fox should choose the course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two started together. The tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue. Slow but steady wins the race. The pomegranate, apple-tree, and bramble the pomegranate and apple-tree disputed as to which was the most beautiful. When their strife was at its height, a bramble from the neighboring hedge lifted up its voice, and said in a boastful tone: &quot;pray, my dear friends, in my presence at least cease from such vain disputings.&quot; the farmer and the stork a farmer placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number of cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the farmer to spare his life. &quot;pray save me, master,&quot; he said, &quot;and let me go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no crane, I am a stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers-- they are not the least like those of a crane.&quot; the farmer laughed aloud and said, &quot;it may be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you with these robbers, the cranes, and you must die in their company.&quot; birds of a feather flock together. The farmer and the snake one winter a farmer found a snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. The snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts, bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound. &quot;oh,&quot; cried the farmer with his last breath, &quot;i am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel.&quot; the greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful. The fawn and his mother a young fawn once said to his mother, &quot;you are larger than a dog, and swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense; why, then, o mother! Do the hounds frighten you so?&quot; she smiled, and said: &quot;i know full well, my son, that all you say is true. I have the advantages you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a single dog I feel ready to faint, and fly away as fast as I can.&quot; no arguments will give courage to the coward. The bear and the fox a bear boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all animals he was the most tender in his regard for man, for he had such respect for him that he would not even touch his dead body. A fox hearing these words said with a smile to the bear, &quot;oh! That you would eat the dead and not the living.&quot; the swallow and the crow the swallow and the crow had a contention about their plumage. The crow put an end to the dispute by saying, &quot;your feathers are all very well in the spring, but mine protect me against the winter.&quot; fair weather friends are not worth much. The mountain in labor a mountain was once greatly agitated. Loud groans and noises were heard, and crowds of people came from all parts to see what was the matter. While they were assembled in anxious expectation of some terrible calamity, out came a mouse. Don't make much ado about nothing. The ass, the fox, and the lion the ass and the fox, having entered into partnership together for their mutual protection, went out into the forest to hunt. They had not proceeded far when they met a lion. The fox, seeing imminent danger, approached the lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the ass if the lion would pledge his word not to harm the fox. Then, upon assuring the ass that he would not be injured, the fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it. The lion, seeing that the ass was secured, immediately clutched the fox, and attacked the ass at his leisure. The tortoise and the eagle a tortoise, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float her in the air. &quot;i will give you,&quot; she said, &quot;all the riches of the red sea.&quot; &quot;i will teach you to fly then,&quot; said the eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashing her shell to pieces. The tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death: &quot;i have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do with wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move about on the earth?' if men had all they wished, they would be often ruined. The flies and the honey-pot a number of flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in a housekeeper's room, and placing their feet in it, ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, &quot;o foolish creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves.&quot; pleasure bought with pains, hurts. The man and the lion a man and a lion traveled together through the forest. They soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone, which represented &quot;a lion strangled by a man.&quot; the traveler pointed to it and said: &quot;see there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts.&quot; the lion replied: &quot;this statue was made by one of you men. If we lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the man placed under the paw of the lion.&quot; one story is good, till another is told. The farmer and the cranes some cranes made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown with wheat. For a long time the farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air, they ceased to take any notice of it and would not move. The farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling with stones, and killed a great number. The remaining birds at once forsook his fields, crying to each other, &quot;it is time for us to be off to liliput: for this man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to show us in earnest what he can do.&quot; if words suffice not, blows must follow. The dog in the manger a dog lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping prevented the oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for them. &quot;what a selfish dog!&quot; said one of them to his companions; &quot;he cannot eat the hay himself, and yet refuses to allow those to eat who can.&quot; the fox and the goat a fox one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape. A goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the fox, inquired if the water was good. Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. &quot;if,&quot; said he, &quot;you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.&quot; the goat readily assented and the fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the goat's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, &quot;you foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.&quot; look before you leap. The bear and the two travelers two men were traveling together, when a bear suddenly met them on their path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. The bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other traveler descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the bear had whispered in his ear. &quot;he gave me this advice,&quot; his companion replied. &quot;never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.&quot; misfortune tests the sincerity of friends. The oxen and the axle-trees a heavy wagon was being dragged along a country lane by a team of oxen. The axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the oxen, turning round, thus addressed the wheels: &quot;hullo there! Why do you make so much noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out.&quot; those who suffer most cry out the least. The thirsty pigeon a pigeon, oppressed by excessive thirst, saw a goblet of water painted on a signboard. Not supposing it to be only a picture, she flew towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed against the signboard, jarring herself terribly. Having broken her wings by the blow, she fell to the ground, and was caught by one of the bystanders. Zeal should not outrun discretion. The raven and the swan a raven saw a swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful plumage. Supposing that the swan's splendid white color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam, the raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his living, and took up residence in the lakes and pools. But cleansing his feathers as often as he would, he could not change their color, while through want of food he perished. Change of habit cannot alter nature. The goat and the goatherd a goatherd had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention to the summons. At last the goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its horn, begged the goat not to tell his master. The goat replied, &quot;Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak though I be silent.&quot; do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid. The miser a miser sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily. One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, &quot;Pray do not grieve so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of it.&quot; the sick lion a lion, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with food by force, resolved to do so by artifice. He returned to his den, and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking care that his sickness should be publicly known. The beasts expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to his den, where the lion devoured them. After many of the beasts had thus disappeared, the fox discovered the trick and presenting himself to the lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful distance, and asked him how he was. &quot;I am very middling,&quot; replied the lion, &quot;But why do you stand without? Pray enter within to talk with me.&quot; &quot;No, thank you,&quot; said the fox. &quot;I notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but I see no trace of any returning.&quot; he is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others. The horse and groom a groom used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his horse, but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own profit. &quot;Alas!&quot; said the horse, &quot;If you really wish me to be in good condition, you should groom me less, and feed me more.&quot; the ass and the lapdog a man had an ass, and a maltese lapdog, a very great beauty. The ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any other ass would. The lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat. The ass, on the contrary, had much work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm. He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his master's house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back. The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: &quot;I have brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day like that useless little lapdog!&quot; the lioness a controversy prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute. &quot;And you,&quot; they said, &quot;How many sons have you at a birth?' the lioness laughed at them, and said: &quot;Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred lion.&quot; the value is in the worth, not in the number. The boasting traveler a man who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on returning to his own country, of the many wonderful and heroic feats he had performed in the different places he had visited. Among other things, he said that when he was at rhodes he had leaped to such a distance that no man of his day could leap anywhere near him as to that, there were in rhodes many persons who saw him do it and whom he could call as witnesses. One of the bystanders interrupted him, saying: &quot;Now, my good man, if this be all true there is no need of witnesses. Suppose this to be rhodes, and leap for us.&quot; the cat and the cock a cat caught a cock, and pondered how he might find a reasonable excuse for eating him. He accused him of being a nuisance to men by crowing in the nighttime and not permitting them to sleep. The cock defended himself by saying that he did this for the benefit of men, that they might rise in time for their labors. The cat replied, &quot;Although you abound in specious apologies, I shall not remain supperless&quot;; and he made a meal of him. The piglet, the sheep, and the goat a young pig was shut up in a fold-yard with a goat and a sheep. On one occasion when the shepherd laid hold of him, he grunted and squeaked and resisted violently. The sheep and the goat complained of his distressing cries, saying, &quot;He often handles us, and we do not cry out.&quot; to this the pig replied, &quot;Your handling and mine are very different things. He catches you only for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for my very life.&quot; the boy and the filberts a boy put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts. He grasped as many as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher. Unwilling to lose his filberts, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his disappointment. A bystander said to him, &quot;Be satisfied with half the quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand.&quot; do not attempt too much at once. The lion in love a lion demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. The father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He expressed his willingness to accept the lion as the suitor of his daughter on one condition: that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both. The lion cheerfully assented to the proposal. But when the toothless, clawless lion returned to repeat his request, the woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his club, and drove him away into the forest. The laborer and the snake a snake, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage, inflicted a mortal bite on the cottager's infant son. Grieving over his loss, the father resolved to kill the snake. The next day, when it came out of its hole for food, he took up his axe, but by swinging too hastily, missed its head and cut off only the end of its tail. After some time the cottager, afraid that the snake would bite him also, endeavored to make peace, and placed some bread and salt in the hole. The snake, slightly hissing, said: &quot;There can henceforth be no peace between us; for whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son.&quot; no one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused the injury. The wolf in sheep's clothing once upon a time a wolf resolved to disguise his appearance in order to secure food more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd by his costume. In the evening he was shut up by the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, and the entrance made thoroughly secure. But the shepherd, returning to the fold during the night to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly caught up the wolf instead of a sheep, and killed him instantly. Harm seek. Harm find. The ass and the mule a muleteer set forth on a journey, driving before him an ass and a mule, both well laden. The ass, as long as he traveled along the plain, carried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend the steep path of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he could bear. He entreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion, that he might carry home the rest; but the mule paid no attention to the request. The ass shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden. Not knowing what else to do in so wild a region, the muleteer placed upon the mule the load carried by the ass in addition to his own, and at the top of all placed the hide of the ass, after he had skinned him. The mule, groaning beneath his heavy burden, said to himself: &quot;I am treated according to my deserts. If I had only been willing to assist the ass a little in his need, I should not now be bearing, together with his burden, himself as well.&quot; the frogs asking for a king the frogs, grieved at having no established ruler, sent ambassadors to jupiter entreating for a king. Perceiving their simplicity, he cast down a huge log into the lake. The frogs were terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall and hid themselves in the depths of the pool. But as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless, they swam again to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began squatting on it in contempt. After some time they began to think themselves ill-treated in the appointment of so inert a ruler, and sent a second deputation to jupiter to pray that he would set over them another sovereign. He then gave them an eel to govern them. When the frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time to jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another king. Jupiter, displeased with all their complaints, sent a heron, who preyed upon the frogs day by day till there were none left to croak upon the lake. The boys and the frogs some boys, playing near a pond, saw a number of frogs in the water and began to pelt them with stones. They killed several of them, when one of the frogs, lifting his head out of the water, cried out: &quot;Pray stop, my boys: what is sport to you, is death to us.&quot; the sick stag a sick stag lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. His companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, and each one helped himself to a share of the food which had been placed for his use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but from the failure of the means of living. Evil companions bring more hurt than profit. The salt merchant and his ass a peddler drove his ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road home lay across a stream into which his ass, making a false step, fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the sack. The peddler retraced his steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream, the ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The peddler saw through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The ass, again playing the fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. And thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his back a double burden. The oxen and the butchers the oxen once upon a time sought to destroy the butchers, who practiced a trade destructive to their race. They assembled on a certain day to carry out their purpose, and sharpened their horns for the contest. But one of them who was exceedingly old (for many a field had he plowed) thus spoke: &quot;These butchers, it is true, slaughter us, but they do so with skillful hands, and with no unnecessary pain. If we get rid of them, we shall fall into the hands of unskillful operators, and thus suffer a double death: for you may be assured, that though all the butchers should perish, yet will men never want beef.&quot; do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another. The lion, the mouse, and the fox a lion, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep in his den. A mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers. He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and searched every corner of his den to find the mouse. A fox seeing him said: &quot;A fine lion you are, to be frightened of a mouse.&quot; &quot;'tis not the mouse I fear,&quot; said the lion; &quot;I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding.&quot; little liberties are great offenses. The vain jackdaw jupiter determined, it is said, to create a sovereign over the birds, and made proclamation that on a certain day they should all present themselves before him, when he would himself choose the most beautiful among them to be king. The jackdaw, knowing his own ugliness, searched through the woods and fields, and collected the feathers which had fallen from the wings of his companions, and stuck them in all parts of his body, hoping thereby to make himself the most beautiful of all. When the appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled before jupiter, the jackdaw also made his appearance in his many feathered finery. But when jupiter proposed to make him king because of the beauty of his plumage, the birds indignantly protested, and each plucked from him his own feathers, leaving the jackdaw nothing but a jackdaw. The goatherd and the wild goats a goatherd, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide, found some wild goats mingled among them, and shut them up together with his own for the night. The next day it snowed very hard, so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold. He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them his own. When the thaw set in, he led them all out to feed, and the wild goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains. The goatherd scolded them for their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd. One of them, turning about, said to him: &quot;That is the very reason why we are so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came after us, you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves.&quot; old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones. The mischievous dog a dog used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and to bite them without notice. His master suspended a bell about his neck so that the dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went. Thinking it a mark of distinction, the dog grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it all over the marketplace. One day an old hound said to him: why do you make such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you carry is not, believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill mannered dog.&quot; notoriety is often mistaken for fame. The fox who had lost his tail a fox caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail. Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other foxes that being tailless was much more attractive, thus making up for his own deprivation. He assembled a good many foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their tails, saying that they would not only look much better without them, but that they would get rid of the weight of the brush, which was a very great inconvenience. One of them interrupting him said, &quot;If you had not yourself lost your tail, my friend, you would not thus counsel us.&quot; the boy and the nettles a boy was stung by a nettle. He ran home and told his mother, saying, &quot;Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently.&quot; &quot;That was just why it stung you,&quot; said his mother. &quot;The next time you touch a nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and not in the least hurt you.&quot; whatever you do, do with all your might. The man and his two sweethearts a middle-aged man, whose hair had begun to turn gray, courted two women at the same time. One of them was young, and the other well advanced in years. The elder woman, ashamed to be courted by a man younger than herself, made a point, whenever her admirer visited her, to pull out some portion of his black hairs. The younger, on the contrary, not wishing to become the wife of an old man, was equally zealous in removing every gray hair she could find. Thus it came to pass that between them both he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his head. Those who seek to please everybody please nobody. The astronomer an astronomer used to go out at night to observe the stars. One evening, as he wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention fixed on the sky, he fell accidentally into a deep well. While he lamented and bewailed his sores and bruises, and cried loudly for help, a neighbor ran to the well, and learning what had happened said: &quot;Hark ye, old fellow, why, in striving to pry into what is in heaven, do you not manage to see what is on earth?' the wolves and the sheep &quot;Why should there always be this fear and slaughter between us?&quot; said the wolves to the sheep. &quot;Those evil-disposed dogs have much to answer for. They always bark whenever we approach you and attack us before we have done any harm. If you would only dismiss them from your heels, there might soon be treaties of peace and reconciliation between us.&quot; the sheep, poor silly creatures, were easily beguiled and dismissed the dogs, whereupon the wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own pleasure. The old woman and the physician an old woman having lost the use of her eyes, called in a physician to heal them, and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses: that if he should cure her blindness, he should receive from her a sum of money; but if her infirmity remained, she should give him nothing. This agreement being made, the physician, time after time, applied his salve to her eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all her property little by little. And when he had got all she had, he healed her and demanded the promised payment. The old woman, when she recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her house, would give him nothing. The physician insisted on his claim, and. As she still refused, summoned her before the judge. The old woman, standing up in the court, argued: &quot;This man here speaks the truth in what he says; for I did promise to give him a sum of money if I should recover my sight: but if I continued blind, I was to give him nothing. Now he declares that I am healed. I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for when I lost the use of my eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and valuable goods: but now, though he swears I am cured of my blindness, I am not able to see a single thing in it.&quot; the fighting cocks and the eagle two game cocks were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard. One at last put the other to flight. The vanquished cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the conqueror, flying up to a high wall, flapped his wings and crowed exultingly with all his might. An eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons. The vanquished cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery. Pride goes before destruction."
